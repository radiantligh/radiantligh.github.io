<h1>Poems</h1>
Below the Surface
<p>I thought I moved on from you
When I came to terms with reality
But your betrayal still stings
It leaves me sighing 
As pain rises to the surface. 
As recount the days our bond decayed
Leaving me wondering 
What made you leave so quick?
</p>
Razor Sharp Words
<p>
My words hurt like serrated teeth
Cutting into flesh as a bite down
my words are painful
When I allow my beast to take over
Causing  other to back away
Wondering if they will see me the same
</p>
<title>Unchained</title>
<p>I hesitate to unchain the beast within.
Nervous to unlock the chains that bind him
Even though his presence brings love peace and joy
His demeanor emits wisdom and calmness 
But who know what he will do when he is free
Guide me deeper into my Shepard’s love and joy
Or darkness and destruction.
Yet I look him in the eye I see me
What will he do if he is free.
</p>	
<title>Leaving the Darkness Behind</title>
<p>He, the Holy Spirit, is calling me to join him
To leave the dark cave of lies, the night of shame and guilt
Where l walk in the sun with him in view
His wings and being projecting a big shadow on the ground
He longs for me to join him of his back 
Enjoys the air and sky with him
So he can teach me to fly and spread my wings
To fly into brighter future away from dark skies
</p>
<p>When I let people in 
Will still see me in the same way 
Or will they run away
When see the things I hid
Along with the beast within 
</p>
<p>
Worthless, Useless, Damaged Goods
The sting of those words fills my conscience
Shaking my head, I long to clear my head hear my lion’s voice
But the sinister cold and twisted voice 
Keeps hounding me
Its presence all encompassing
A hurricane swirling around me
The pain of lies feeling blades piercing my skin
Wanting to subdue me to defeated state.
I remember what my King and Shepard told me
That I was precious to him and He lay down his life to show me
That I am many of the children he loves dearly
But rest on my knee in pain
Wrestling between the truth of the Father and the lies
Wondering I should fight or succumb to the lies
</p>
<p>
I see it in his eyes, yes he is free
But he longs for a connection
For me to touch his head and feel his mane
His skin a little rough but smooth and soft
Almost like satin, pleasant to the touch
He longs for my hands to touch hom in a kind way
To know that a great, fearsome, and passionate creature
Can have his head held by someone he cares about
Maybe that’s what my Lion is longing for to loved and acceptable by me.
</p>
<p>
Do not let it bother you
It will only last a little while 
Pain I hold it in
Push against the rushing rivers
Suppressing something we are meant to feel
Letting wash over our body, mind and soul
Sitting in it and engage in it
Let in a weird way become our teacher
From pain allow ourselves to begin anew

<h2>Stories</h2>
Holy Spirit Living with Us
<p>
As he enters the room, I remember that day he first knocked on my door.
Those soft yet firm knocks on the doors that alert me of a visitor
At first, I was nervous, could it be a friend? I was not expecting any visitors at that time of day
So, I get up from the couch I was sitting on, moving at a slow pace
Uncertainty grabbing my heart and lungs
Filling me with anxiety and stress.
I reach the door and my hand wraps around knob
Feeling the cold knob, I turn the knob.
As the door swings open, A figure in a clean, beautiful white robe appears.
“Hello, Ryan”, How are you doing?  Its nice to finally see you again”
“Who are you? I ask him and how do you know me.”
I have known you since I created you.” He said
He came inside and we begin to have a lengthy conversation
As I finish reminiscing that day.
My close friend and Father, gets on the couch and settles in.
I look at Him taking in his majestic face and mane.
He chose to appear as a majestic Lion.
“What you are thinking about as I approached my Son?, He asked. saw that reflecting look on your face.”
“Well, I was thinking of the day you knocked on that door and walked in my life the for the first time”. I answered.
How that day change my life.
He smiled, a huge grin on his face. “Yeah I enjoyed it too, to finally see your face after all those years”
“You were so nervous and anxiety, I sensed that., he continued.
“Now here we are best friends, and you having residence it my life.  My Great friend.”
“Yes”, He said, Even with your taking a while to truly believe my saving grace, and sole provider of salvation
“Yeah with you even taking residence in different bedrooms.”
“Now you sleep in the master bedroom, because you are my King, Shepherd and Lord.” I offer.
My house is yours and so is my heart.
Wordlessly the Lion places his head and neck on top on my body.
Allowing a tender moment to happen.
He looks at me with those golden eyes and says. “I care about you, my child”
“My Beloved,  I love these moments we share together”. 
“When you do my will and obey, I am filled with joy and pride.” 
“Cause you are my own.”
“Now, you ready to serve me and love those I created.” The lion said.
“Yes, My Lord Jesus Christ, I am always yours “ I said
”And it’s a joy to advance your kingdom and bring you glory in serving you.” a smile cracks from my lips
He gets off me, jumps off the couch and looks at me.
	“Why did you do that?” I asked questioning his rapid movement
Looking at me, he said “Beloved, I wanted to get a good look at your face, before we begin the day.”

Fork in the Road
<p>
Fork in the Road

Most of my life I have traveled on many roads
Some filled with dirt and bumps. Some smooth and easy
Some a mixture of both. 
These roads have been my teachers 
And I their student
I have met many travelers on these roads
Some have become family members
Kind, supportive, encouraging and always by my side
Some have been travelers.   
And some were friends who in the end hurt me
Being selfish and leaving me broke down on the road.
As my feet softly pound the ground,
One by one memories of the events past
Flashing in my mind
Yet I am still alive, not dying.
I smile and let a soft sigh
Never in the million years would
I thought my life would be like this and have these opportunities 
After being in my head for a moment
I become aware of the roads before me
They split into two different way
Staring at both options; I become very deep in thought
One road be very rough and painful but filled with joy and love
The other one, is more peaceful and less painful but love, joy and peace will be less
I step toward the more challenging road 
Immediately, a sinister, and cold voice whispers.
You will never make it
You don’t have the talent to impress
What will others think of your decision. 
That voice filled my being with fear
Causing me to step back and lose my confidence
Inside I feel shaken, unsure and unsteady
I felt as all my strength if not gone
Moments later I felt the presence of great being
I met him on the many roads I traveled
And He has become my closest friend, a Father even
I turn around and behold Him,
A great lion with an aura of majesty and splendor
A great, beautiful and magnificent golden mane draped over his neck and shoulders
A body lined with powerful lean muscle 
And eyes when you look into them, your see a golden glint of flame in them
He is a wonder to behold Him in all his glory,

Instinct I drop to my knees, awestruck feeling little in his huge presence.
In a few second’s my body stars to tremble.
Then I hear his strong yet gentle voice, Child, Do not afraid, Stand up and Come near
I get up slowly and regain my footing and walk up to the Lion,
I stop before Him and behold Him
Child, It is good to see you again
Didn’t we see each other just a few hours ago?
Yes, He said with a chuckle, I always enjoy seeing my son
You’re dear to me as all my children are.
Moments passed as we enjoy this wordless moment together.
Before I began to speak, The Lion sits down and said “Tell me what is on your heart, my friend.
Jesus, I don’t know if I can walk the road you have for me
Yes, There is great joy, peace, and rich blessings 
But I sense great sorrow, pain, uncertainty and betrayal as well.
I do not believe I up for the task. 
My voice echoes the doubt hanging over my heart and soul.
After, long pause that seemed like to go on forever
My Son, look at my face and look me in the eye.
As I look up into His beautiful face,
And his golden eyes.
As He says to me.
I am glad you admit you can’t do it on your own
Only with me as, your constant companion, you can walk it
Yes that will have moments where the grief, the pain 
Where things will make no sense 
In this those moments, Me and your family be there to support you
To lend a shoulder to cry on, a ear to hear your joys and sorrows 
Ready to encourage you and breath new strength into your spirit.
Take heart, my child and remember I will always be beside you and I go before you
I have already made the way for you.
All you have to do is trust me.
Glancing into those soul piercing yet gentle eyes
I see him wordlessly pleading to me
Do you trust me?
Inside my mind feel turmoil as I wrestle between the lies, fear, truth and hope
But again I look towards the Majestic lion in front of me.
Suddenly I feel at peace and that everything is going to be ok in end 
When I am by his side.
Yes, I trust you, God, Lead down that path
Pleased with my response, The Lion grins and his eyes the beam with pride
Well Let’s go, My child, The journey awaits.
I crack a smile as he start stop walk towards the path ahead,
I take a step forward following my close friend
Ready for the journey ahead.

Freed from my chains
<p>Freed From my Chains.
Cold, That’s how it feels in this cave.
Chained to a wall, the holder firmly hammered into the cave’s wall.
Cold circles in close my wrists and ankles
I have been at the mercy of my cruel masters
Pride, Worry, Busyness and Fear.
All of them working me to the bone
Leaving me ragged and tired by the end of the day
When they lead me back to cave,
Shackled, Cold and Barely Clothed.
Honestly almost Naked, All the Clothes we got here are ripped or torn.
Barely covering our bodies.
Our master keeps us warm enough, so we don’t die of hypothermia
Resting against the wall, I breathe softly and deeply enduring the pain my body has bore
I move to get into an easy position to sit.
But I feel the shackles rub  against the already raw flesh and skin around my tender wrist and ankles
This isn’t what I was planning my life to turn out,
I thought my life would be nice when I choose to live without God
I nice career as a business man, with friends to laugh with and support me, and kids to raise up and love on them with great love.
But instead I chained to a wall, deprave of the basic human needs.
I long to be free from these holding me down
To walk freely and do life with people who are free and focus on life. 
Can somebody save from this horrible place, I said
Immediately, I began to pray,
“God, Please come and save me,” 
“I am sorry for the sins I have commit and that I choose to live my life on my own terms.”
“I ask that you come into my life, forgive my sins and allow you to be Lord of my life.”
Amen, a few moments later, a figure in a white appears in a glorious and beautiful light.
I straight up and tremble at this glorious being entering the room
Overwhelm by his presence, tremble and fall to my knee even as I feel pain of shackles rubbing on ankles and wrists.
The man begins speaking, “Ryan, my son do wish to be free from these chains.”
“Yes, My Lord, I am willing to be free and live under your rule and guidance.”
I said as I lifted my chained hands in the air.
Even with his face is hard to see, I sense him smiling upon me
“Very well, my child, I will free you.” He said
Immediately, using a sword appearing out of nowhere, he slices and breaks the chains
I then position my legs to allow cut off the chains around my ankles.
He cuts those chains as well, chains dropping with a clink 
After all this, he takes my arms and apply a smooth yet fragment ointment unto 
My raw wrist and applies it tenderly 
Then produces strips of soft cloth to wrap my wrists.
After feeling the pain for the rawness, in a few minutes my wrist being soothed.
I sighed as the pain begun to dull
He smiled and said “my child you are now free”
“Child”? “I ask quietly.
Yes, you are my child now forever.
Tears begun to spill out my eyes.
Oh what wonderful news, 
Once a slave, now I am a child of the Most High God
In bursts of joy, I begin to praise God and Jesus, for the freedom for he has given me
During this time. All I can feel is love, joy, and warmth and pride emiting from The man in front of. 
My son, Let’s go leave this cave and go to place to rest for the night, you will enjoy the sunset where we are going.
“Is it far from here” I ask.
“I little bit, but the view will be worth the walk”.
“Ok, Father lets go” I say with joy.
Yes, lets go, I will keep you safe throughout the night
Thank you for freeing me, Jesus
Your welcome, my son, I enjoy setting my people free from bondage.
We share a smile together as we walk towards the sun
Beginning a journey that has the best yet to come
